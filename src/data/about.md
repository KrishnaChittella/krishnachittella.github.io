# Intro

I am a graduate student at the University of South Dakota. I took a course in Computer Science in the hopes of learning new technology and improve. In my spare time, I play video games and enjoy the beauty of nature.

# Some history

- I got my first computer in the year 2004 when I was 3. It's an HCL laptop and I still remember it to this day, It ran Windows XP. I got few games, mostly Tom and Jerry and DOOM(The old version).

- At 8, I beat Minesweeper on for the first time.

- At 12, I came to know the understadning of the hierarchy of the computer. (I know too late but still got to know.)

- At 13, I got my first PSP, sad part is I didn't know that it has no connection to the internet (poor me).

- 14 - Now, I play a lot of video games. My favorites included Rainbow Six Siege, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Frostpunk.

- At 21, I got my certification in Bachelor of Technology, Computer Science and Engineering.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
